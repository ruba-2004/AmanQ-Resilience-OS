# AMAN-Q: Quantum-Resilient Distributed Operating System

## 🚀 Project Overview
AmanQ is a hybrid resilience architecture designed to protect critical data during catastrophic node failures. It combines a user-friendly Virtual WebOS with a high-security AI Kernel.

## 🏗️ Architecture
This project is designed as a distributed cluster.
- **Controller Node (The Brain):** FastAPI Kernel running on VM-1 (192.168.200.10). Handles Quantum Optimization and Encryption Vault.
- **Edge Nodes (The Muscle):** AI Agents running on VM-2 and VM-3. Equipped with Isolation Forest models for anomaly detection.
- **Frontend (The Face):** React/Node.js Virtual Desktop Interface.

## 🔧 Technology Stack
- **Backend:** Python, FastAPI, Scikit-Learn (AI), Fernet/AES (Crypto).
- **Frontend:** React, TypeScript, Node.js.
- **Algorithms:** Simulated Annealing (Load Balancing), Isolation Forest (Threat Detection).

## 📦 Installation
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install Python dependencies: `pip install -r requirements.txt`
3. Install Node dependencies: `cd frontend && npm install`

## 🛡️ Security Features
- **Lattice-Based Encryption:** Post-Quantum ready signatures.
- **Zero-Latency Evacuation:** Data is encrypted and offloaded milliseconds before system crash.
